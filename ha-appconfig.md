# High availability design for your workloads
{: #high-availability-design}

{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} supports high availability application deployments within a single zone, across multiple zones in a multi-zone region, and across multiple regions.

Failure domains determine the degree of protection from infrastructure failures for each deployment option. An application instance that is deployed in a single zone is not protected against a failure of that zone. Application instances that are deployed in multiple availability zones are protected against a failure of a single zone. The multiple availability zones are within the same metropolitan area and are connected by low latency network links that allow data to be synchronously replicated across the zones. Application instances that are deployed in multiple regions are protected against a failure of an entire region. Different regions are located in different countries or in different parts of a single country. The distance between regions typically only allows data to be replicated asynchronously.

The following table shows application deployment options based on failure domains available in a public cloud.



| Deployment          | Availability | Failure domain                | Cost and complexity |
|-------------------------------|--------------|-------------------------------|---------------------|
| Single-zone, \n single-region | Low/Med      | Virtual Server / Physical Host| Low                 |
| Multi-zone, \n single-region  | High         | Zone                          | Medium              |

## Single-zone deployment
{: #single-zone}

In single-zone deployments, multiple application instances are deployed in one zone. If an application instance runs in a single virtual server, [Placement Groups](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-about-placement-groups-for-vpc) allow these virtual servers to be provisioned in separate physical hosts. [VPC Autoscale](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-creating-auto-scale-instance-group) can be used to enable dynamic capacity adjustment based on workload changes. Single zone deployments provide cost-effective solutions with 99.9% infrastructure availability. This deployment might be appropriate for nonproduction environments or nonbusiness critical applications. However, single-zone deployments provide no protection from zone outages.

## Multi-zone, single-region deployment
{: #multi-zone-single-region}

In a multi-zone, single-region deployment, multiple application instances are deployed across two or more availability zones within the region. Multi-zone, single region deployments can provide up to 99.99% infrastructure availability, when the application is deployed across three availability zones. This deployment protects the application from zone failures, and is suitable for production-level enterprise workloads with \>99.9% availability requirements. Actual application availability depends on the application high availability design.

When using this deloyment model, it is a best practice to avoid zonal imabalances. A zonal imbalance is where capacity - for example, VPC Virtual Server Instances (VSIs) - is not spread evenly across zones.  Consider an example where a workload is deployed with 70% of its VSI capacity in zone 1, 20% in zone 2 and 10% in zone 3. If zone 1 were to fail, the workload may continue to be avialable but with only 30% of it's capacity. One solution is to provision more resources if an outage to zone 1 occurs, but the outage may cause an abnormal spike in capacity demand in the remaining zones. A better solution is to remove the imbalance and ensure that the required capacity is spread across the zones, with an additional overhead of around 17% in each zone to counterbalance the loss of any single zone.  This ensures that the workload remains available and can operate at full capacity, should the loss of a zone occur.

## Multi-zone, multi-region deployment
{: #multi-zone-multi-region}

A multi-zone, multi-region deployment provides protection against region outages. This deployment is recommended for mission-critical applications with continuous or near-continuous availability requirements. This deployment also supports out of region disaster recovery and business continuity for applications with cross-geography or specific separation distance requirements.

Multi-zone deployments rely on application-aware data replication across availability zones and support active-active and active-standby architecture patterns. Multi-zone, multi-region deployments support architecture patterns for enterprise applications with continuous availability and always-on requirements. The following tables show a comparison of the different deployment options and recommended use.

| Deployment    | Availability | Description   | Recommended use   |
|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|
| Single-zone                | 99.9%         | - Multiple compute instances in one zone \n - Protection from infrastructure failures \n - Low/Medium cost \n | - Low to medium priority applications \n - Noncritical production workloads |
| Multi-zone, single-region | 99.99%        | - Multiple compute instances across 2 or more availability zones \n - Synchronous data replication across zones \n - Protection from zone outages \n - Medium/high cost | - Core business applications \n - Production level workloads with stringent resiliency requirements \n - Business continuity policies with country boundaries or geographic data residence constraints |
| Multi-zone, multi-region  | &amp;gt;99.99%     | - Multiple compute instances across multiple availability zones in 2 or more regions \n - Asynchronous data replication between regions \n - Protection from region outages \n - High cost | - Mission-critical applications with continuous or near continuous availability requirements \n - Business continuity policies with cross-geography or specific separation distance requirements \n - Disaster recovery |

The following Architecture Framework provides design considerations and architecture decisions for deploying resilient applications on IBM Cloud Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) infrastructure. It covers the following solution aspects and domains:

- **Networking:** Load balancing, Domain name system
- **Security:** Data security
- **Resiliency:** High availability, Backup and restore, Disaster recovery
- **Service Management:** Monitoring, Logging, Auditing, Alerting

The [Architecture Design Framework](/docs/architecture-framework) provides a consistent approach to design cloud solutions by addressing requirements across a set of aspects and domains. The domains are architectural areas that need consideration for any enterprise solution, regardless of technology.

## Client retry logic for highly available applications
{: #client-retry-logic-for-ha}

You are responsible for building client applications that can handle temporary errors effectively. Temporary errors include network errors and temporary failures that are introduced by a service's high availability implementation, like when a regional service recovers from a zonal failure. For more information on specific {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} services, see [Service documentation for high availability and disaster recovery](/docs/resiliency?topic=resiliency-service-ha-dr).

Many of the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} SDKs are built on the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} SDK Common](https://github.com/IBM/ibm-cloud-sdk-common?tab=readme-ov-file#automatic-retries) that supports automatic retries that are designed to handle specific HTTP errors, like 429 and 503 errors. The SDK doesn't handle all errors automatically. To take advantage of the retry logic, you must configure the SDK correctly.

Some {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} services support open source protocols, and it can be appropriate to use open source SDKs. Examine these SDKs to determine whether they are useful for your application and offer suitable retry functions.

Retry logic varies depending on the type of {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} service and the type of operation. Some failed operations produce retry-friendly status codes, and some produce status codes that are not retry-friendly. Failed read and HTTP GET operations can generally be retried by using exponential backoff with a fixed time period. Exponential backoff is a retry strategy to manage retries after a failed operation, such as a network request or API call. It gradually increases the delay between retries in an exponential pattern, which reduces the risk of overloading the system. The failures that should be retried depends on the type of failure and the specific {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} service. For more information, see each {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} services SDK and documentation.

Failed write, HTTP PUT, POST, DELETE, and other operations likely aren't recoverable by using a simple retry mechanism, unless it's clear that the operation didn't complete and the documented client logic indicates that a retry is appropriate. When an operation that changes the state of a system, like creating a resource, fails, it’s often unclear what caused the failure. Because of this uncertainty, you can’t rely on simple retry logic to fix the issue. Instead, use more advanced methods that are designed specifically for the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} service.

Client retry improves the availability of a single client, and workloads can be composed of many clients. Logging client failures to a centralized logging service like [{{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}}](/docs/cloud-logs?topic=cloud-logs-getting-started) allows failure and availability analysis of the entire workload.
